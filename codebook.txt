The data in this dataset is a tidied data from an accelometer test

The data is giving you the following information:

trainSubject: integer
	1-30
	The subject of the test, that is the person subject to the test. Different persons are identified with a number.

Activity: integer
	The activity the subject was doing during the measurements. The variable has six levels:
	1: LAYING 
	2: SITTING 
	3: STANDING 
	4: WALKING 
	5: WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 
	6: WALKING_UPSTAIRS

The rest 66 variables are the mean values of the calculated mean and standard deviation for 17 different measurements.

	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation

	tBodyAcc-XYZ
	tGravityAcc-XYZ
	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	tBodyGyro-XYZ
	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	tBodyAccMag
	tGravityAccMag
	tBodyAccJerkMag
	tBodyGyroMag
	tBodyGyroJerkMag
	fBodyAcc-XYZ
	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	fBodyGyro-XYZ
	fBodyAccMag
	fBodyAccJerkMag
	fBodyGyroMag
	fBodyGyroJerkMag

The variables that have dimensions(movements directions) -XYZ have three different mean and standard deviation value; 
one for each dimension. For example the first variable of the group is called tBodyAcc-mean()-X.
